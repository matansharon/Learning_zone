    "# Summary: Measures of Central Tendency in Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This lecture focuses on understanding the measures of the center of a dataset, specifically discussing mean, weighted mean, truncated mean, mode, and median.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean (Arithmetic Mean)\n",
    "- **Calculation**: Sum of all data points divided by the number of data points.\n",
    "- **Population Mean (µ)**: Mean of the entire population.\n",
    "- **Sample Mean (x̄)**: Mean of a sample from the population.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: Viewed as the balancing point of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weighted Mean\n",
    "- **Use Case**: When different data points carry different weights (e.g., employee satisfaction scores from departments of different sizes).\n",
    "- **Calculation**: Sum of products of scores and weights divided by the sum of weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Truncated Mean\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Data with outliers.\n",
    "- **Calculation**: Mean calculated after removing certain highest and lowest data points (outliers).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mode\n",
    "- **Definition**: The value that occurs most frequently in a dataset.\n",
    "- **Types**: Unimodal (one mode), Bimodal (two modes), or no mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Median\n",
    "- **Calculation**: Middle value of an ordered dataset (or mean of two middle values if dataset size is even).\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: Useful when dataset contains extreme values/outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing the Right Measure\n",
    "- **Depends on**: Data type (continuous, discrete, nominal, ordinal), numeric nature, and context.\n",
    "- **Median vs Mean**: Median is often more representative in datasets with extreme values.\n",
    "- **Applicability**: Not all measures are applicable to all data types (e.g., median not suitable for nominal data).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Understanding when to use mean, median, or mode is crucial in data analysis. The choice depends on the dataset's characteristics and the context of the analysis.\n"
