    "# Introduction to Simple Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple probability is fundamentally about calculating the likelihood of an event, \"Event A\", occurring, which is determined by the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Probability of Event A} = \\frac{\\text{Number of matching outcomes}}{\\text{Number of total outcomes}} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Matching outcomes** are outcomes that satisfy the conditions of Event A.\n",
    "- **Total outcomes** are all possible equally likely outcomes in the scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Flipping a Coin\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider flipping a two-sided coin (heads and tails) and calculating the probability of getting heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total outcomes: 2 (heads or tails)\n",
    "- Matching outcomes for heads: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Probability of heads} = \\frac{1}{2} \\] or 50%.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Rolling a Six-Sided Die\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the probability of rolling a two:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total outcomes: 6 (1 through 6)\n",
    "- Matching outcomes for a two: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Probability of rolling a two} = \\frac{1}{6} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "For rolling an even number:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matching outcomes (2, 4, 6): 3\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Probability of rolling an even number} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\] or 50%.\n",
    "\n",
    "For rolling a number greater than two:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matching outcomes (3, 4, 5, 6): 4\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Probability of rolling > 2} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} \\] approximately 67%.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complementary Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "The complement of an event (denoted as \\(A'\\)) is the scenario where that event does not occur. The sum of the probability of an event and its complement always equals 1 (or 100%).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: If the probability of rolling a two is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\), the probability of not rolling a two is \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimental vs. Expected Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expected probability** is theoretical, based on the assumption of equally likely outcomes.\n",
    "- **Experimental probability** varies with actual experiments and gets closer to expected probability as the number of trials increases, demonstrating the law of large numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Law of Large Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "The more we repeat an experiment, the closer the experimental probability will align with the expected probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Small sample sizes can lead to high variability in experimental probability.\n",
    "- Larger samples give a more accurate estimate of the expected probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This underscores the importance of using large datasets to derive more reliable estimates of probability.\n"
