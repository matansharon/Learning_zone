    "# Computer Vision Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "- Computer vision problems involve interpreting visual data, similar to how humans perceive images.\n",
    "- Machine learning, especially using PyTorch, is a powerful tool for solving computer vision challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs and Outputs in Computer Vision\n",
    "- **Inputs**: Typically, images are represented as tensors with dimensions for height, width, and color channels (RGB).\n",
    "    - For example, a 24x24 image with 3 color channels would be represented numerically to capture the intensity of red, green, and blue at each pixel.\n",
    "- **Outputs**: The goal is often classification, where the model predicts the probability of the image belonging to certain classes (e.g., sushi, steak, pizza).\n",
    "    - The output is structured as a vector of prediction probabilities, one for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi-classification Example\n",
    "- An app that identifies food in images demonstrates the application of computer vision in multi-classification.\n",
    "- The process involves numerically encoding images into tensors and using a machine learning model (e.g., CNN) to classify the images into predefined categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\n",
    "- CNNs are the go-to model for image data, known for their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images.\n",
    "- They work by applying filters to the input images to extract features, which are then used for classification or other tasks.\n",
    "- Recent research also highlights the effectiveness of transformer architectures in handling image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Considerations\n",
    "- **Tensor Shapes**: Ensuring compatibility between input and output tensor shapes is crucial. Common dimensions include batch size, image height and width, and color channels.\n",
    "- **Model Training**: Improving model performance can involve showing more varied examples or adjusting the model architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "- Computer vision encompasses a broad range of problems from classification to object detection and segmentation.\n",
    "- Successful application requires understanding both the theoretical underpinnings and practical aspects of machine learning models and data representation.\n"
