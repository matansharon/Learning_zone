    "\n",
    "### Getting Help\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Follow along with the code**: Actively participate by coding along.\n",
    "- **Use the docstring**: For understanding function usage, utilize the shortcut `Shift + Command + Space` on Google Colab or `Control` on Windows.\n",
    "- **Search online**: Look up your code issues on platforms like StackOverflow or the PyTorch documentation.\n",
    "- **PyTorch discussions**: If you're still stuck after trying the above, post your question in the PyTorch deep learning repo's discussions tab under the appropriate section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PyTorch Deep Learning Repo**: Contains all code for this section and more, serving as a valuable reference.\n",
    "- **Course Book**: The book version of this course provides detailed explanations and additional resources. Check the \"PyTorch Computer Vision\" section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Computer Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer vision is a broad field capable of solving various problems, from simple image classification to complex object detection. PyTorch offers extensive support for computer vision tasks through its `torchvision` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary Classification**: Distinguishing between two classes, e.g., is an image a steak or pizza?\n",
    "- **Multiclass Classification**: Classifying images into multiple categories, e.g., identifying images of sushi, steak, or pizza.\n",
    "- **Object Detection**: Locating specific objects within an image, such as identifying a car involved in a hit-and-run incident.\n",
    "- **Semantic Segmentation**: Dividing an image into segments to identify and classify each part of the image separately, e.g., differentiating between the sky, buildings, and people in a photograph.\n",
    "- **Real-World Applications**: Demonstrated through projects like Nutrafol for food classification and Tesla's self-driving technology, leveraging computer vision for autonomous navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Course Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Acquiring Vision Datasets**: Using `torchvision` to obtain datasets for computer vision tasks.\n",
    "- **Understanding CNN Architecture**: Exploring how convolutional neural networks are structured and function in PyTorch.\n",
    "- **Modeling with CNNs**: Building and training CNNs for multiclass image classification, selecting appropriate loss functions, and optimizing the model.\n",
    "- **Evaluation**: Methods for assessing model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The course combines theoretical knowledge with practical coding exercises, resembling a blend of art and science akin to cooking in a machine learning context. By actively engaging in code-writing and experimentation, learners will gain a comprehensive understanding of computer vision with PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following videos, we will delve into the inputs and outputs of computer vision problems, laying the groundwork for practical exercises and deeper learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "*This course aims to equip you with the knowledge and skills to become a Deep Learning Engineer and secure employment in the field.*\n"
